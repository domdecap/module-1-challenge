# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? -->

This purpose of this challenge was to help demonstrate our knowledge of HTML semantic elements and CSS identifiers. We were first given starter code with no semantic elements whatsover. We were instructed to replace them with semantic elements. Using semantic elements allows accessability devices, such as ereaders, to properly layout the information to the end user. It also helps with creating an easily interpretable HTML document.



## Installation

Navigate to <insert URL here>

## Usage

To view the source code of the site, using Firefox, go to Tools -> Browser Tools -> Web Developer Tools. You can see that the code has been properly refactored and commented to allow for easier use.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
